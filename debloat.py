"""Interactive console util to toggle macOS launchd services on/off.

Shows current disabled state, lets you flip checkboxes, applies diff with sudo
on Enter.

The top rows are a preset menu — enter on one applies it right away. Below
that the Spotlight file index, then every launchd service. `[✓]` means on,
`[ ]` means off, `*` marks a row that changes on enter, and a spinner marks
a row the system has not finished settling into (Spotlight rebuilding).

Keys:
  ↑/↓ or j/k   move
  PgUp/PgDn    jump 10
  [/]          jump to prev/next section
  space        toggle current row
  enter        on a menu row apply that preset, otherwise apply the ticked
               changes (prompts sudo)
  r            reload state from system
